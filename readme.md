This is a part of fork of a mirror of a [vimscript](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=4325)

This script will convert a file to a highlighted version using ANSI escape codes and print it to your terminal, like cat only with colors.

This script started as part of the [vimpager project on vim.org](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1723) (now [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/rkitover/vimpager), where you can file issues and submit pull requests).

This project is [eponymously hosted](https://github.com/jalanb/vimcat), so you can likewise.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:

Most of the code in this script is not mine, I only kept taking lumps out till it worked for me, consistently.

[Matthew Wozniski](mailto:mjw@drexel.edu) wrote the original vim script for highlighting with ANSI codes, Magnus Woldrich ([converted it to shell](https://github.com/trapd00r/utils/blob/master/_v)), and [Chris Chambers](mailto:krijesta@google.com) fixed the bugs in the bleeding background colours.
